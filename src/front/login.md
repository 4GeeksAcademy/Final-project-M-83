## Steps For When A User First Opens The Website:
1. Website should open to the homepage
2. Top of NavBar is where the Sign In/Log In button is located, and where the user will click to either create a profile or sign in (if they are returning).
    - Only the sign in/log in button should be visible IF the user has NOT made a profile (subject to change, need to consult with Alex and group).
    - If the user is logged in, then every other aspect should be visible and interactable, as well as a message saying "Welcome [user's name]".
3. Clicking the Sign In/Log In button on the top should lead to Gabby's Login Modal (design from Figma)
    - Within this Modal the user can either:
        1. Log In if they already made a profile
        2. Sign Up to create a profile by clicking "Register an account". Clicking this button could open another modal?

## About The User Profile Page:
Within this page is where the user will see and be able to access all information about their problem which should/could have the following:
1. Profile image (should be a stock image if the user chooses not to upload their own image)
2. Their phone number (if the user chooses to provide their phone number)
3. The user's email
4. A card to the right showcasing all the people the user had voted for (maybe it should say "My Votes" instead of "My Matches" as the user is mainly just voting and not creating matches)
5. A card saying "My Love Island Account" where the use is able to delete their profile

## About The Voting Page:
- On this page, the user is able to vote for their favorite islanders; need to ask/confirm if all the islanders will be viewable from this page? 
- If the user has NOT registered an account, then they could still see which islanders are able to be voted for, the user just wont be able to vote if they have NOT made a profile and are NOT logged in. 
    - The "vote" button could be *hidden* if the user is not logged in?

## If We Incorporate a "All Islanders Page", Then Read The Following:
The following below allows for the user to read about each Islander, potentially building a "connection" with some, thus influencing their votes when they do vote.
- Here the user could read information about each islander:
    - Name
    - Age
    - Hometown
    - Occupation
    - Quick bio about who they are
